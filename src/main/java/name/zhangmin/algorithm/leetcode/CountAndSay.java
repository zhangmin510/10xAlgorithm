/**

 * 38. Count and Say.</a>
 * <p>
 * The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with
 * the first five terms as following:
 * <pre>
 * 1.     1
 * 2.     11
 * 3.     21
 * 4.     1211
 * 5.     111221
 * </pre>
 * 1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.<br>
 * 11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.<br>
 * 21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.<br>
 * <p>
 * Given an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, generate the nth term of the
 * count-and-say sequence.
 * <p>
 * Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented
 * as a string.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:<br>
 * Input: 1<br>
 * Output: "1"<br>
 * <p>
 * Example 2:<br>
 * Input: 4<br>
 * Output: "1211"<br>
