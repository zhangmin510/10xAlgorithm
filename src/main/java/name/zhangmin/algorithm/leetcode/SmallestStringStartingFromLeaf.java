 * <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-string-starting-from-leaf/">
 * 988. Smallest String Starting From Leaf</a>
 * <p>
 * Given the root of a binary tree, each node has a value from 0 to 25
 * representing the letters 'a' to 'z': a value of 0 represents 'a', a
 * value of 1 represents 'b', and so on.
 * <p>
 * Find the lexicographically smallest string that starts at a leaf of this
 * tree and ends at the root.
 * <p>
 * (As a reminder, any shorter prefix of a string is lexicographically
 * smaller: for example, "ab" is lexicographically smaller than "aba".
 * A leaf of a node is a node that has no children.)
 * <p>
 * Note:<br>
 * 1. The number of nodes in the given tree will be between 1 and 8500.<br>
 * 2. Each node in the tree will have a value between 0 and 25.<br>
